## Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Gabriel Chazarreta. I'm from Argentina and I'm a Fullstack Developer.

## Skills
I'm a passionate developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, SQL, TypeScript, and Next.js. My journey in web development has allowed me to gain a solid understanding of these technologies and their practical applications.

Throughout my coding adventures, I've honed my skills in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create stunning and responsive user interfaces. With React.js, I've built dynamic and interactive web applications, harnessing its component-based architecture and virtual DOM.

On the back-end, I've leveraged Node.js to develop server-side logic, build RESTful APIs, and handle data retrieval and manipulation. My experience with SQL databases has equipped me with the ability to design efficient database schemas and write optimized queries.

Additionally, my proficiency in TypeScript has empowered me to bring strong typing and enhanced scalability to my projects, ensuring robust and maintainable codebases. I've also explored the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and building fast, SEO-friendly web applications.
